Privacy Policy — UtilityKit

Last updated: 2025-09-05

This Privacy Policy explains how UtilityKit (the “App”) handles information. UtilityKit works entirely on your device. We do not collect, track, sell, rent, or share personal data.

Summary
- Data collected: None
- Tracking: None
- Accounts: None
- Third‑party SDKs: None
- Network calls: None (the App functions offline)

What the App Does
UtilityKit provides four tools: Calculator, Notes, To‑Do, and Unit Converter. All inputs and content are processed locally on your device.

Data We Do NOT Collect
We do not collect, transmit, or process any personal information or device identifiers, including but not limited to: name, email, phone, IP address, precise location, advertising identifiers, diagnostics, or usage analytics.

Local Data on Your Device
Some features store small amounts of information locally on your device using Apple’s UserDefaults:
- Notes: note title and content
- To‑Do: task title, status, priority
- Calculator: optional calculation history

Local data never leaves your device unless you choose to back up your device through Apple services. You can remove data at any time by deleting notes/tasks/history from within the App or by deleting the App, which removes all locally stored data.

Permissions
The App does not request any system permissions (camera, contacts, location, etc.).

Children’s Privacy
The App is suitable for all ages and does not collect personal data from anyone, including children under 13 (or the equivalent age of digital consent in your jurisdiction).

International Users / Legal Bases
Because we do not process personal data, no GDPR/CCPA legal basis is required. If regulations change or features expand to include online services, we will update this policy and the App Store privacy disclosures accordingly.

Data Security
Your content resides only on your device. Protect access to your device with a passcode/biometrics to keep your data secure.

Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy from time to time to reflect product or legal changes. The latest version will be available inside the project bundle and on your support site, if applicable.

If you are a user exercising privacy rights (e.g., access or deletion), note that all data is stored locally on your device; deleting the App removes all stored data.
